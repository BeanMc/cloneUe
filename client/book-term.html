                    <h2>BOOKING TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br></h2>
                    <p>These are the&nbsp;<strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>&nbsp;that will apply to your booking.
                        Please read them carefully as you will be bound by them.</p>
                    <h3>1. BOOKING / NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT</h3>
                    <p>You must pay us a non-refundable deposit of the amount stated in the Tour Description (the
                        “Deposit”) at the time of booking. The Deposit is to be paid when the on-line booking form is
                        filled up and submitted to us. If you are making a booking for a Tour which is scheduled to
                        start in 4 weeks, you must pay us the full amount of the Tour Price.</p>
                    <h3>2. CONFIRMATION OF BOOKING</h3>
                    <p>Our receipt of the Deposit and the completed booking form does not mean that your booking is
                        confirmed and accepted. It is only confirmed and accepted when we give you a written
                        confirmation. This written confirmation will also contain details on regarding the payment of
                        the balance of the Tour Price. However, if your booking is not accepted by us, we will refund
                        the Deposit which you have paid to us.</p>
                    <h3>3. FINAL PAYMENT SCHEDULE</h3>
                    <p>If the balance of the Tour Price is not paid by the dated specified in the written confirmation
                        referred to in Clause 2, your booking is deemed to be cancelled and we shall forfeit the
                        Deposit.</p>
                    <h3>4. PRICES</h3>
                    <p>We conduct various Tours from time to time. The price of each Tour will be specified on our
                        website (“Tour Price”). However, sometimes, due to external factors beyond our control (e.g.
                        increase in transport costs or food costs or tour leader’s fees or instructors’ fees or currency
                        fluctuations), the Tour Price may increase even after you have booked for our Tours. Should
                        there be any increase in the Tour Price after you have placed your booking with us, we will
                        notify you of the increase. You have the option of either accepting the change in price or
                        withdraw from the Tour. Should you withdraw from the Tour, we will refund the Deposit to
                        you.</p>

                        flights specified by us. Participants arriving or departing on different flights will be
                        responsible for their own transfer costs and arrangements.</p>
